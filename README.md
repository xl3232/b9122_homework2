### Author Information
The repository contains two code files.
The file named as "webcrawler" was created by Prof. Kriste Krstovski.
And the file end with .ipynb was created by Xinyi Luo.
### Code description
The file end with .ipynb contains the code for two exercises.
Basically they are pretty similar and come from the code of Prof. Krstovski.
We first define a function according to the type of url that we have to verify whether the element that we want is in the url text or not. This contains opening url, reading url, extracting the text and verify whether in or not.
Then we follow the idea of the course code to go through all the pages under the seed url and store those containing the element. 
For these two exercises, given the difference of requirement, we have different while statement for the length of the list.
